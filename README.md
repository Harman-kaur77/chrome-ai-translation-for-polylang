# ðŸ§  Chrome AI Translation for Polylang

Creating multilingual WordPress sites with **Polylang** can take time since it doesnâ€™t automatically translate content.  
Most translation plugins offer automation, but theyâ€™re often **paid**, have **limited editor support**, or require **complex setup**.

When **Chrome** launched its built-in **AI Translator API**, I saw a way to simplify this process.  
Thatâ€™s how **Chrome AI Translation for Polylang** was created â€” a **free addon** that uses Chromeâ€™s **local AI** to instantly translate WordPress pages.
