# 🧠 Chrome AI Translation for Polylang

## 🌍 Inspiration

Creating multilingual WordPress sites with **Polylang** can take time since it doesn’t automatically translate content.  
Most translation plugins offer automation, but they’re often **paid**, have **limited editor support**, or require **complex setup**.

When **Chrome** launched its built-in **AI Translator API**, I saw a way to simplify this process.  
That’s how **Chrome AI Translation for Polylang** was created — a **free addon** that uses Chrome’s **local AI** to instantly translate WordPress pages.

## ⚙️ What It Does

**Chrome AI Translation for Polylang** is an addon that works with the **Polylang** plugin to make page translation automatic and effortless.

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Install** Polylang and Chrome AI Translation for Polylang addon.
2. **Open** any page or post and click the **“+”** icon next to your target language.
3. **Confirm** the popup to duplicate and translate your content automatically using **Chrome’s AI Translation API**.
4. If you close the popup, click **“Translate Page”** anytime to start translation manually.
5. All translations happen **locally in the browser** — fast, secure, and fully compatible with **Gutenberg**, **Classic Editor**, and **Elementor**.
6. Once the translation is ready, click **“Update Content”** to save it instantly without reloading the page.

## 🏗️ How I Built It

- **Integration with Polylang:**  
  This addon builds on **Polylang’s** multilingual features and adds automatic translation using **Chrome’s AI**, so you can translate content with just one click.

- **Editor Compatibility & UI:**  
  It works smoothly with **Gutenberg**, **Classic Editor**, and **Elementor**, with a simple, modern popup that feels like part of WordPress itself.

- **Error Handling System:**  
  If something goes wrong, the addon shows a clear message to help you enable **Chrome’s Translation API** or install missing **language packs**, so you’re never stuck.

## 🧩 Challenges I Ran Into

- **API Integration Errors:**  
  Initially, it was tricky to enable the **Chrome Translation API** and manage missing language packs.  
  This was fixed by adding clear error popups with helpful documentation links.

- **HTML and Formatting Issues:**  
  Some translations messed up the page layout. To solve this, a **React-based filter system** was added to keep the structure and formatting intact.

- **Exploring Browser AI:**  
  Working with **on-device AI** was a challenge at first, but it turned out to be a great learning experience — showing how local AI can make WordPress automation faster and smarter.

This saves users time, money, and effort while keeping translations secure within their browser.
